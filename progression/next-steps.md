# Next steps

Suggested order, from cheapest/most informative to most expensive.

## 1. Validate what runs (immediate)
- [x] Run `scripts/run.sh` and record what appears. Result: the intro animated movie plays on screen.
- [x] Fix the random intro freeze/crash (KI-7, input race in the SDK).
- [ ] Record whether the intro has sound, whether it can be skipped, and what happens when it ends (title screen, black screen, crash). If it crashes, note the last `[FATAL]` line from `build/run.log`.

- [x] Song list after creating a party (KI-12, `XNetRandom`). A full song plays.
- [ ] **Gameplay performance (top priority):** frame rate is very low during songs while menus are smooth. Profile first (`perf record -g` on the running game; check whether the cost is guest code, the Xenos/Vulkan backend, XMA audio decoding or Bink), then consider `-O2` for the generated code (currently `-O1` because of RAM), GPU readback/resolve settings and the `Skipping Vulkan frame presentation` path.
- [ ] Remove or gate the `--debug_probe` watch list once it is no longer needed (it only reads memory and is off by default).

## 2. Stability of the recompiled code
- [x] Remove bogus orphan entries that split switches/SEH functions (KI-8): 115 unresolved sites → 0.
- [ ] Identify the 4 functions still PENDING and add `[[switch_tables]]` if needed.
- [ ] Re-check the 52 remaining `orphan_*` entries for SEH resume blocks (harmless today, but dead).
- [ ] Run longer scenarios (menus, loading a song) and repeat the missing-function loop (`scripts/resolve_orphans.py`) whenever `unregistered function` shows up.
- [ ] Decide whether to generate a complete vtable report to anticipate missing functions instead of waiting for each crash.

## 3. Title update
- [ ] The game looks for `update:\gen\patch_xbox.hdr`. Investigate whether the TU in `game/$SystemUpdate/su20076000_00000000` is an XEXP that should be applied to `default.xex` (XEXLoaderWV supports XEXP) and whether it changes the code.
- [ ] If so, recompile from the patched XEX and rebuild the manifest.

## 4. Audio and video
- [ ] Confirm XMA decoding (music and SFX) and latency.
- [ ] Check the `Skipping Vulkan frame presentation due to async placeholder draw usage` message and whether it affects the picture.
- [ ] Bink video playback: the intro movie already shows; verify audio sync and the other movies in the game (`BINK*` blocks in the XEX).

## 5. Instruments (the distinguishing feature of this game)
- [x] Let a gamepad act as guitar/bass/drums (`--instruments`, KI-9).
- [ ] Map how the game reads guitar/bass/drums/microphone (USB HID through XInput / `XamInput*` / `XUsb*`?) and what the ReXGlue runtime already exposes.
- [ ] Keyboard mapping: right now only a real gamepad reaches the game (check the SDK's `mnk` input driver / `input_backend`).
- [ ] Microphone capture for vocals (3-part harmonies).

## 6. Persistence and extras
- [ ] Saves (XContent/STFS), profile and achievements.
- [ ] DLC / extra songs (STFS under `Content/`).

## 7. Project quality
- [ ] Push the repository to GitHub and pick a license.
- [ ] Document the manifest quirks discovered so far (see `AGENTS.md`) where other ReXGlue users can find them.
- [ ] Consider contributing fixes or reports back to ReXGlue (vtables without RTTI).
